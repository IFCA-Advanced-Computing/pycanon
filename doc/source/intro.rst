Whats's pycanon?
##########################
Pycanon is a `Python`_ library which allows the user to know the anonymity level of a dataset based on a set of quasi-identifiers (QI), and a set of sensitive attributes. To do so, it provides a set of functions to compute the anonymity level of a dataset by means of the following techniques:
* k-anonymity
* (:math:`\alpha`,k)-anonymity
* :math:`\ell`-diversity}
* Entropy :math:`\ell`-diversity 
* Recursive (c,:math:`\ell`)-diversity
* t-closeness
* Basic :math:`\beta`-likeness 
* Enhanced :math:`\beta`-likeness
* :math:`\delta`-disclosure privacy
